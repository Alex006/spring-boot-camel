# Spring-Boot Camel QuickStart

This example demonstrates how you can use Apache Camel with Spring Boot.

The quickstart uses Spring Boot to configure a little application that includes a Camel
route that triggers a message every 5th second, and routes the message to a log.


### Building

The example can be built with

    mvn clean install


### Running the example locally

The example can be run locally using the following Maven goal:

    mvn spring-boot:run


### Running the example in OpenShift

It is assumed a running OpenShift platform is already running.

Assuming your current shell is connected to OpenShift so that you can type a command like

```
oc get pods
```

Then the following command will package your app and run it on Kubernetes:

```
mvn fabric8:run
```

To list all the running pods:

    oc get pods

Then find the name of the pod that runs this quickstart, and output the logs from the running pods with:

    oc logs <name of pod>
